# fantasy-football-draft-tool

This tool randomly matches fantasy football teams with drivers in an event to then allow the relative finishing position of the drivers to determine the fantasy football draft order.

## Usage

1. Create a folder named `input/` at the root directory.
2. Then create a file named `owners.txt` for each team owner in your league and another file named `options.txt`, which will contain the possible options to match an owner with.
3. Run the program with `cargo run`.

**Note:** The files must contain the same number of names.
