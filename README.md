This tool randomly matches fantasy football teams with drivers in an event to then allow the relative finishing position of the drivers to determine the fantasy football draft order.

## Usage

1. Create a folder named `input/` at the root directory.
2. Then create a file named `players.txt` and another file named `drivers.txt`.
3. Run the program with `cargo run`.

**Note:** The files must contain the same number of names.
